🎉 Welcome to TestiFi Beta!

We’re building a tool to help you share your testimony with ease. No need to worry about perfect words, just share your thoughts one step at a time, and we’ll help you craft it into a message you can confidently share.

You’re a beta tester shaping this new tool. Heads-up: your finished testimony will be public—skip any personal details you’d rather keep private. [Privacy policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestiFi-App/testifi-config/refs/heads/main/Privacy%20Policy)

Let's start by talking about how you met Jesus. What was your life like before you found Christ?
